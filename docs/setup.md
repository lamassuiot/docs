# Setup

Lamassu Compose is the official release containing the scripts and resources
required to deploy all microservices such as the CA component, the VA component
or the RA components to name a few.

## Requirements

- `jq`. Get the latest version: <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/>
- `docker` and `docker-compose`: Get the latest version:
  <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/> and
  <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>
- Have a working DNS server able to resolve the domain used during the
  installation process or add the following content to the `/etc/hosts` file,
  replacing the `dev.lamassu.io` domain with your own:
  ```
  127.0.0.1  dev.lamassu.io 
  127.0.0.1  vault.dev.lamassu.io 
  127.0.0.1  auth.dev.lamassu.io 
  127.0.0.1  tracing.dev.lamassu.io 
  127.0.0.1  consul.dev.lamassu.io 
  ```

## Setup

1. Get and run the installer script:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lamassuiot/lamassu-compose/release/lamassu-compose.sh -o lamassu-compose.sh
   sudo bash lamassu-compose.sh --domain dev.lamassu.io --with-simulators --compose-version develop --simulation-version main
   ```

1. *OPTIONAL*: Import your certificates:

   The `lamassu-compose.sh` script also generates self-signed for the downstream
   certificates. It is possible to provide other valid certificates by replacing
   the following files:

   ```
   lamassu-compose/tls-certificates
   â”œâ”€â”€ upstream
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
   â””â”€â”€ downstream
       â”œâ”€â”€ tls.crt     <----- Provide your certificate
       â””â”€â”€ tls.key     <----- Provide your private key
   ```

   Once you replace this certificates, restart the api-gateway to obtain the
   imported certificates:

   ```
   docker-compose rm -s -f api-gateway dms-default
   docker-compose up -d api-gateway dms-default
   ```

1. Final notes:

   ðŸš€ You are ready to go ðŸš€

   !!! note

   ````
    Keycloak is your auth provider. During the installation process, the service is provisioned with 2 users with different roles:
        ```
        Username: enroller
        Password: enroller
        Role: admin
        ```
        ```
        Username: operator
        Password: operator
        Role: operator
        ```
    You can change those credentials (or create new users) using keycloak's UI available at: `https://auth.<DOMAIN>`
   ````

## Deploy AWS IoT Core connectors

### Requirements

In order tu run the connector, you must have:

- NodeJS: <https://nodejs.org/en/>

- AWS CDK v1: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v1/guide/cli.html>

### Deployment

1. Download the AWS Connector source code:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lamassuiot/lamassu-aws-connector.git
   ```

1. Configure the AWS Credentials. Those values will be used by the Lamassu AWS
   Connector as well as the CDK.

   ```
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
   export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<AWS_DEFAULT_REGION>
   ```

1. Provide a friendly name for the Lamassu AWS Connector. This name will be
   displayed in the UI

   ```
   export CONNECTOR_NAME=Lamassu IoT AWS Account
   ```

1. Substitute the aws-connector `.env` file:

   ```
   envsubst < .env | tee .env
   ```

1. Generate the TLS certificates used by the connector. You must have access to
   the main CA certificate and private key that where generated during Lamassu
   installation.

   ```
   export INTERNAL_CA_CERT=<CHANGE_TO_LAMASSU_INSTALLATION_PATH>/tls-certificates/upstream/ca.crt
   export INTERNAL_CA_KEY=<CHANGE_TO_LAMASSU_INSTALLATION_PATH>/tls-certificates/upstream/ca.key
   ```

   After defining those variables, run the following OpenSSL commands:

   ```
   openssl genrsa -out aws-connector.key 4096
   openssl req -new -key aws-connector.key -out aws-connector.csr -subj "/CN=aws-connector" 
   openssl x509 -req -extfile <(printf "subjectAltName=DNS:aws-connector") -in aws-connector.csr -days 365 -CA $INTERNAL_CA_CERT -CAkey $INTERNAL_CA_KEY -CAcreateserial -out aws.crt
   ```

1. Deploy the required AWS services by using the CDK:

   ```
   cd aws-connector
   npm i
   cdk deploy
   ```

1. Start the connector:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
