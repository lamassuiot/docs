# Tests

Integration test are carried out to check the proper functionabillity of the
server. The tests, start up the same server used in production with an empty
database and run against the server using HTTP.

To create the test, _httpexpect_ library has been used; a set of chainable
builders for HTTP requests and assertions for HTTP responses and payload, on top
of net/http and several utility packages.

Each test-case has three arguments: the name of the test, an instance of the
service and a _httpexpect.Expect_ object, upon which the rest call will be made.

Passing an instance of the service per test, allows custom inicialization of the
database per test. Also, as the service used is the exact same used in
production, the calls made from one service to another are mantained, allowing
to check the interoperability from services.

The response obtained from the _httpexpect.Expect_ object will be evaluated; the
response's keys and values will be revised to compare with the expected ones. If
the expected results donÂ´t match with the obtained ones, an error will occur,
allowing the developers to notice and fix it before releasing it into
production.

Three different branches are differenciated:

- Development: this branch is used for testing purposes whenever a service is
  modified to check the proper functionabillity of the same service.
- Release: this branch is used for testing purposes whenever a service is
  modified to check the proper functionabillity of the all services.
- Main: once the test are passed successfully, changes are published in _main_
  branch.

## Coverage

The following commands can be used to calculate the coverage of the system:

```
go test -json -v ./pkg/... -cover  -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

go tool cover -func coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print substr($3, 1, length($3)-1)}' | .github/coverage-badge.sh
go tool cover -func coverage.out | grep total
```

The total and relative percentages of each component can be found in the
resulting _cover.html_ file. Opening the file in the browser, will mark the
tested code in green and the untested one in red.

The resulting _cover.out_ file, can be imported to _go-cover-treemap.io_ webpage
to generate a visual representation of the coverage results:

### Pipeline

The test are run against the server using HTTP, the top layer of the system.
Facilitating the task of testing the layers below.
